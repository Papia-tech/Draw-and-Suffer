# 🖥️ ROOT_ACCESS_TERMINAL
## Geometry-Driven Interactive Terminal

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**ROOT_ACCESS_TERMINAL** is a browser-based terminal simulation where **user-drawn shapes** dynamically control **system difficulty and behavior**.

The project combines:
- Canvas-based drawing
- Accuracy-driven logic
- Terminal-style UI
- Dynamic difficulty selection

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- User draws a **basic geometric shape**
- The system evaluates **drawing accuracy**
- Accuracy determines:
  - Difficulty level
  - System stability
  - Triggered challenges
- Low accuracy causes **system crash simulation**
- User must solve a task to continue
